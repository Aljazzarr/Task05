Given a string. check if the string is symmetrical and palindrome or not. A string is said to be symmetrical if both the halves of the string are the same and a string is said to be a palindrome string if one half of the string is the reverse of the other half or if a string appears the same when read forward or backward.
Hint: Ignore the spaces, dots, or commas in the string.
test1 = "ZakZak"
test2 = "Zakaria"
test3 = "A war at Tarawa."
test4 = "madam"

# Needed To be Output

ZakZak is symmetrical, but ZakZak is NOT a palindrome.
################################
Zakaria is NOT symmetrical, and Zakaria is NOT a palindrome.
################################
A war at Tarawa. is NOT symmetrical, but A war at Tarawa. is a palindrome.
